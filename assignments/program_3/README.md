Assignment: Program 3

Description:
***Fun Part:*** <br>
>Were going to create crazy names similar to what github and repl.it do when suggesting names for repls or repos. Github suggests things like: `musical-journey` or `cautious-waffle` or `bug-free-succotash`. Whereas repl.it suggests things like:  `LikelyTatteredGreatwhiteshark` or `PepperySunnyMaggot` or `ClearcutLongtermCrocodile` or `RowdyWorthwhileBird`. I'm not sure what thier algorithm is, but I'm sure we can come up with something better (or at least similar). 

***Data Structures Part:*** <br>
>After we generate about 10000 names, we are going to compare the performance of a Binary Search Tree vs an AVL tree when it comes to finding those named components in each tree.
